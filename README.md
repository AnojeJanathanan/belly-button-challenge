# belly-button-challenge

In this module, I will be creating a nice looking, red dashboard which allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provided.

With my dashboard, anybody can select a test subject ID from the dropdown menu to view demographic information and visualize the microbial data for further insight.
